# Diabetes Risk Prediction 

# Purpose
It provides an easy-to-use AI-ML web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health indicators. It demonstrates how ***machine learning models*** can be integrated into interactive web apps for real-time health risk assessment.

# Importance
***Early detection***: Supports timely medical consultation and preventive action.

***Accessibility***: Allows anyone with internet access to check their diabetes risk.

***Educational value***: Illustrates end-to-end ML project workflow â€” from preprocessing and modeling to deployment.

# Dataset Used
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Features:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age

 # Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Missing values handled; features scaled using StandardScaler.

Class Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE to balance diabetic/non-diabetic cases.

Model Selection: Chose Random Forest for its robustness and interpretability.

Model Training: Performed training with hyperparameter tuning.

Model Saving: Saved trained model and scaler using Joblib for reuse.

Deployment: Built an interactive UI in Streamlit for predictions.
